## 📋 **Overview**
Welcome to the "Introduction to Cloud Computing" workshop! In this session, we will explore the world of cloud computing and its applications. Cloud computing has revolutionized the way businesses and individuals store, manage, and process data. This workshop aims to provide you with a solid foundation in cloud computing concepts, services, and benefits. 

## 🎯 **Objectives**
By the end of this workshop, you will:

- Understand the fundamental concepts of cloud computing. 
- Learn about different cloud service models and deployment models.
- Explore popular cloud service providers such as AWS, GCP and Azure. 
- Gain hands-on experience with cloud resources and services such as AWS Amplify and AWS S3 Buckets.
- Understand the benefits and challenges of cloud adoption. 

## 🔍 **Prerequisites**
To participate in this workshop, you should have a basic understanding of computer systems and networking. Familiarity with programming concepts and the command line interface will be beneficial. Please ensure you have the following requirements met:

- Laptop with internet connectivity. 
- Web browser (preferably Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox).
- A valid email address to create accounts on cloud platforms. 
- Credit Card Details to signup for AWS.

## 🚀 **Workshop Outline**

*The workshop will consist of the following sections:*

1. Introduction to Cloud Computing
    - Overview of cloud computing and its importance: 
        - Cloud Computing is defined as the practice of using remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage and process data rather than using a local. 
    - Benefits and challenges of adopting cloud services.

        | IAAS | Infrastructure as a Service | Amazon EC2, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud VPC |
        | SAAS | Software as a Service | Gmail, Google Docs, Salesforce |
        | PAAS | Platform as a Service | Heroku, Azure App Service, AWS RDS |
    

3. Cloud Deployment Models
    - Public, private, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments. 
    - Considerations for choosing a deployment model. 

    | Cloud Deployment Models | Considerations |
    | --- | --- |
    | Public Cloud | Scalability, Cost, Convenience |
    | Private Cloud | Control, Security, Compliance |
    | Hybrid Cloud | Flexibility, Data Sovereignty, Cost |
    | Multi-cloud | Vendor Lock-In, Redundancy, Data Portability |


4. Popular Cloud Service Providers
    - Amazon Web Services (AWS)
    - Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

5. Hands-on Cloud Experience
    - Account setup on AWS.  
    - Hosting a website or app using AWS on Free Tier can be done in two ways: 

    | Hosting an App or Website on AWS Free Tier |
    | AWS Amplify | A service which is dedicted to hosting website and application on AWS Cloud, similar to Vercel and other wesbite/app hosting services. |
    | AWS S3 Buckets |  |
